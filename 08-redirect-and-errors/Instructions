Let's see how many you remember?

response -> used to instantiate response

Want examples? Look at all the previous instances we have been using this! :P

Flask has 'abort()' function which can be used to send an error code. (Use it with conditions)

Method : abort(errorCode). Common Codes : 400 - Bad Request, 401 - Unauthenticated, 403 - Forbidden, 404 - Not Found.


You can use errorhandler decorator to make custom error pages for specific error codes.
Can use this to create some fun and custom 404 error pages.
