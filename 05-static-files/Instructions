Suppose you want to use some JavaScript / CSS (static files).

These files are served in the 'static' folder of your package.

Special end point static is used to generate URL for static files.

Project-Directory
	|
	|--app/
		|
		| -- views.py
		| -- static/
			  | -- validate.js
			  | -- styles.css
		| -- templates/
			  | -- login.html
			  | -- about.html

This way you can serve the front-end JavaScript and CSS with your HTML Files.
