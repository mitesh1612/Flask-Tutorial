Various HTTP Methods : GET and POST. Differences?

By default, Flask responds to GET requests. 

To consider other methods, we can provide 'methods' argument in route() decorator.

HTTP Consists of 2 parts. The Request and Response

Client --> Request --> Server
Client <-- Response <- Server

Any data sent from the client side is stored in "request" object

If request is GET, request.args is a dictionary containing a pairs of parameter name and values

If request is POST, value of parameters can be obtained from form data as request.form['<field-name>']

request object also contains the following important attributes :

Form - Dictionary containing key and value pairs of form parameter and values
args - parsed contents of query string which is part of URL after '?'
Cookies - Dictionary object holding Cookie names and values
files - data pertaining to upload module
method - current request method.
