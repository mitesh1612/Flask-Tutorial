Why Templates?

Sending data to create dynamic web pages.

Want to keep the logic of the application seperate from the layout / presentation of the web pages.
(Then you can code the backend part while a designer designs the front-end of your site.)

Directory Structure :

(Only changes are shown. Rest files are omitted!)

Project-Directory
	|
	|--app/
		|
		| -- templates/
			  | -- index.html
			  |	-- base.html (New File Created)

Used placeholders in the html file ( Enclosed in  {{..}} )

Use Control Statements and Loops enclosed in {% .. %}

Template Inheritance

To keep an element common across all the pages/templates (or even some of those)
Include it in the template
(Example : Navbars)
