# Flask Tutorial

Here are some files (demo codes and Instructions/theory along with them) for the Flask Tutorial I made as part of my Scripting TAship.

The tutorial is inspired mostly from the following links:

* [Flask Megatutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world-legacy)
* [Flask - Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/index.htm)

But some ideas were also taken from the following links:

* [Simple Web App using Python Flask and MySql](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-python-flask-and-mysql--cms-22972)
* [CRUD App using Flask](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one)
* [CRUD App using Python and Flask](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/23/build-a-simple-crud-app-with-flask-and-python)
